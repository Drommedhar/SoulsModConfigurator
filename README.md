## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- .NET 8 Runtime
- Valid installation of supported Dark Souls games
- Internet connection for automatic mod downloads

### Setup
1. Download the latest release of SoulsModConfigurator
2. Extract to a folder of your choice
3. Run `SoulsModConfigurator.exe`
4. Use the built-in download manager to automatically get mod files (recommended)
   - OR manually download and place the required mod files (see "Manual Mod Files Setup" section below)

## Automatic Mod Download

SoulsModConfigurator now includes an integrated download manager that can automatically download all required mod files from Nexus Mods (Premium required) and other sources.

## Manual Mod Files Setup

If you prefer to download mod files manually or the automatic download system is not available, you can still manually download and place the required mod files.
For that open the Download manager and after that click on `Manual Download`. This will open the required mods in your browser and in the output give information on where to place the mods and how to name them.

**Tip**: Use the automatic download manager instead of manual downloads to avoid naming issues and ensure all files are correctly placed.
